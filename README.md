# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code ðŸŽ„

Hey :)

This is a repository where I keep track of all my AOC submissions.

- 2022
  - I'm working on AOC 2022 to practice Rust.
  - Since I'm using AOC primarily to teach myself a new language, the code quality will probably not be amazing - hopefully it'll get better over time!
  - After solving each day, these resources are useful in learning how other people approached the day's puzzle:
